    <h3>Hello and Welcome to My Website</h3>
        <p>My name is Randeep Mangat,
        I am 27 years old and I have always enjoyed working on/with 
        computers. In fact it is my love for computers that prompted me to
        pursue a degree in computer science. Immediately after graduating,
        I went on to serve in the United States Army as a tanker, being
        put in a leadership position early on taught me many critical life
        skills. While I was enlisted I had also pursued a criminal 
        justice degree. My years in the service, and in college taught me
        many critical skills, such as: Leadership, communication, teamwork,
        administrative work, proficiency with many different programming languages
        such as, c++, javascript, php, css, html, and even SQL. I also became proficient
        with the Microsoft office suite as well as having attention to detail.
        If you would like to know more about my technincal skills please download my
        resume on the contact page.
